<h1>About</h1>

<p>
foounit is an asynchronous BDD-style javascript test framework aimed at making cross-environment javascript testing simple.  foounit is designed to make testing code that is shared between the server and the client less of a chore.  It supports both commonjs loading and global scope loading of script files for immediate test dependencies in all environments.  Test files are loaded in a functionally scoped environment to help minimize test pollution when running your suite.  Test syntax is influenced heavily by Screw Unit,  Jasmine and rspec.</p>

<p>
  foounit is the love child of Bob Remeika (<a href="http://bobremeika.com">me</a>).  It was <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/foobarfighter/status/71670398349099008">written out of spite</a> while consuming large amounts of alcohol.  If you notice some bad code within foounit, it's definitely due to alcohol abuse.  I'm not even going to try to pretend that I *meant* to do that.  If you want to help with code quality then <a href="https://github.com/foobarfighter/foounit">patches are accepted</a>.

<p>
  foounit is currently used at <a href="http://www.yammer.com">Yammer Inc.</a> as the primary test harness for a core component of our client/server side architecture called yamjs.
